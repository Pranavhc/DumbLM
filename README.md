**me**: one plus one equals?

**this guy**:  
one plus one equals one. You can get a 1-1 split by making an integer. You can also get a 0-1 split by using the integer as the unit of measure of the two.

The first one equals one. The second one equals two. The third one equals three. It's all about the integer, but it's not really what you want.

The second one is the same, but you can get a 1-1 split by adding it to the second one.

**me**: wtf is this guy talking about T-T

**this guy**:
one plus one equals one for the rest of the body. In fact, it is possible to change your position in the head by simply removing the head from the body, and then changing the position of one part of the body to another. This can be done by moving your hands slowly, or by twisting your arms, legs, or neck or by pulling your shoulders. This technique can also be performed with a flat object such as a finger.
